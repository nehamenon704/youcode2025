# ArcTrail

## Our solution aims to create a platform for grant recipients, ambassadors and community partners to be connected based on their identified strengths and weaknesses. We recognize that organizations are stronger when they work together and want to provide the opportunity to create a welcoming community for trusted recipients to find support, identify organizations for collaborations and participate in community-wide problem solving.
